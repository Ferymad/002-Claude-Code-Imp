Force agents to disagree before reaching consensus.

Usage: /consensus-break

Triggers the consensus-breaker agent to orchestrate a structured debate:
- Defender argues implementation is perfect
- Attacker finds flaws and proves them  
- Alternative proposes different approach

Only proceed when 2/3 agree AFTER seeing all evidence and arguments.

Use when agents immediately agree on complex implementations (suspicious).
