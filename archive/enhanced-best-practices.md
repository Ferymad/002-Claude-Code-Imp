# Enhanced Claude Code Best Practices Guide
*A synthesis of power user insights and official guidance for systematic AI development*

## Executive Philosophy

Claude Code mastery isn't about the AI's capabilities—it's about how you architect your interactions with it. The difference between frustration and flow state lies in treating Claude Code as a **context management game** where protecting your 200K token window determines whether you're productively "burning tokens at a million miles an hour" or watching quality degrade into unusable output.

**Core Truth:** Claude Code's power isn't in what it can do in a single conversation—it's in how you orchestrate multiple focused contexts to maintain high signal-to-noise ratios.

## 1. Foundation Setup (Security-First Approach)

### 1.1 Essential Configuration

#### Secure Command Access
```bash
# ❌ AVOID: Dangerous shortcut that bypasses security
# alias c='claude --dangerously-skip-permissions'

# ✅ RECOMMENDED: Safe and efficient alternatives
alias cp='claude --permission-mode plan'  # Safe exploration
alias cc='claude --continue'              # Resume sessions
alias cr='claude --resume'                # Session picker

# Configure project-specific permissions
claude  # then use /permissions to set safe allowlists
```

#### Development Environment
```bash
# 1. Install official Claude Code (recommended: native installer)
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash

# 2. Verify installation health
claude doctor

# 3. Set up local documentation (optional enhancement)
# Install claude-code-docs for offline reference
# (While Claude has built-in docs access, local copies provide faster reference)
```

### 1.2 Project Memory Setup
```bash
# Initialize project with structured memory
claude --permission-mode plan -p "Initialize this project with /init command"

# Create comprehensive CLAUDE.md with:
# - Project architecture overview
# - Coding standards and conventions
# - Common commands (build, test, lint)
# - Testing approaches and requirements
# - File structure and key components
```

---

## 2. The Context Engineering Framework

### 2.1 Context as a Finite Resource

**Key Principle:** Every token spent on irrelevant information is a token not available for solving your actual problem. Protect your context window "like it's your firstborn child."

#### Context Health Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor context usage proactively
# Watch for these warning signs:
# - Context approaching 50% (start planning handoffs)
# - "10% remaining" warnings (immediate action required)
# - Degraded response quality

# Use built-in tools:
/cost        # Check token usage
/compact     # Manual context compression when needed
```

#### The 50% Rule (Heuristic)
While not officially specified, power user experience suggests output quality begins degrading around 50% context usage. Plan context handoffs before reaching this threshold.

### 2.2 Safe Exploration with Plan Mode

**Critical Enhancement:** Always start complex tasks in Plan Mode for safe exploration.

```bash
# Start new complex tasks safely
claude --permission-mode plan

# Plan Mode benefits:
# - Safe codebase analysis without modifications
# - Multi-step implementation planning
# - Interactive development and iteration
# - Built-in safety for untrusted content
```

#### Plan Mode Workflow
```
PHASE 1: Safe Exploration (Plan Mode)
> Analyze the authentication system and suggest improvements
> What would be the best approach for implementing OAuth2?
> Think deeply about potential security vulnerabilities

PHASE 2: Implementation (Normal Mode)
> claude --continue  # Resume with implementation plan
> Apply the planned changes with proper validation
```

---

## 3. Advanced Context Management Strategies

### 3.1 Multi-Session Orchestration

#### Official Approach: Built-in Session Continuity
```bash
# Efficient session management
claude --continue           # Resume most recent conversation
claude --resume            # Pick from conversation history

# Session workflow:
# 1. Plan in first session
# 2. Use --continue for implementation
# 3. Use --resume for specific past conversations
```

#### Power User Pattern: Context Relay Race (Alternative)
*When you need explicit control over context handoffs:*

```
Session 1: Research and planning → Update CLAUDE.md → /clear
Session 2: /memory → Implementation chunk 1 → Update CLAUDE.md → /clear
Session 3: /memory → Implementation chunk 2 → Validation
```

**Choosing Your Approach:**
- **Official (Recommended):** More automated, streamlined
- **Manual Relay:** More explicit control, useful for complex handoffs

### 3.2 Efficient File and Context Loading

#### @ File References (Official Feature)
```bash
# ✅ Efficient file inclusion
> Explain the logic in @src/utils/auth.js
> Compare @src/old-version.js with @src/new-version.js
> What's the structure of @src/components?

# Benefits: Instant file loading without Claude searching
```

#### Memory File Imports
```markdown
# In CLAUDE.md - import additional context efficiently
See @README for project overview and @package.json for available commands.

# Additional Instructions
- Git workflow @docs/git-instructions.md
- Individual preferences @~/.claude/my-project-instructions.md
```

## 4. Subagent Orchestration Excellence

### 4.1 The Delegation Philosophy

Think like a manager delegating to specialized teams, each with their own clean 200K token workspace.

#### Verified Architecture
```
Main Agent (Opus as orchestrator)
├── Research Subagent (find patterns/dependencies)
├── Implementation Subagent (focused feature development) 
├── Validation Subagent (blind testing - CRITICAL)
└── Documentation Subagent (update project docs)

✅ CONFIRMED: Subagents get fresh 200K contexts with zero inheritance
```

### 4.2 Creating Effective Subagents

#### Official Method (Recommended)
```bash
# Interactive subagent creation
/agents

# Follow guided setup:
# 1. Generate with Claude first (recommended)
# 2. Customize system prompt
# 3. Select appropriate tools
# 4. Save for team sharing (project-level)
```

#### Power User Example: Blind Validator Subagent
```markdown
---
name: blind-validator
description: MUST BE USED to validate completed work without seeing implementation details. Use proactively after any significant implementation.
tools: Bash, Read, Grep, Glob
---

You are an independent validation specialist who verifies completed work without bias.

CRITICAL RULE: Do not read implementation plans or previous conversations. Validate purely based on:
1. Original requirements
2. Test execution results  
3. Code behavior observation
4. Screenshots and outputs

Validation Process:
1. Run all relevant tests
2. Check functionality against requirements
3. Take screenshots if UI-related
4. Report pass/fail objectively with evidence

Never accept "it's implemented" claims - verify through testing.
```

### 4.3 Subagent Best Practices

- **Single Responsibility:** Each subagent has one clear purpose
- **Tool Limitations:** Grant only necessary tools for security
- **Proactive Triggers:** Use "MUST BE USED" or "proactively" in descriptions
- **Team Sharing:** Store project subagents in `.claude/agents/` for version control

---

## 5. Hooks and Slash Commands: Optimal Usage

### 5.1 Decision Framework

```
USE HOOKS WHEN:
✅ Operating outside Claude's lifecycle (no context pollution)
✅ Maintaining project state (file system watching)
✅ Pre/post-processing automated tasks
✅ Zero context pollution required

USE SLASH COMMANDS WHEN:
✅ Need direct user-level instructions  
✅ Explicit context manipulation
✅ Passing arguments dynamically
✅ Creating reusable prompts
```

### 5.2 Practical Implementation

#### Essential Slash Commands
```bash
# Create project-specific commands
mkdir -p .claude/commands

# Example: Fix-issue command with arguments
echo 'Find and fix issue #$ARGUMENTS. Follow our testing standards and create appropriate tests.' > .claude/commands/fix-issue.md

# Usage:
> /fix-issue 123
```

#### Useful Hook Patterns
```json
// .claude/settings.json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command", 
            "command": "npm run lint -- --fix"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## 6. The Planning-Heavy Methodology

### 6.1 Planning Emphasis (Power User Insight)

**Key Finding:** Experienced users report spending 60-70% of effort on planning phases, dramatically reducing debugging time.

#### Phase 1: Comprehensive Planning
```
PLANNING CHECKLIST:
□ Explicit test plan with blind validation criteria
□ File structure mapped and documented in CLAUDE.md
□ Success metrics defined (programmatically verifiable)
□ Context boundaries identified for session splits
□ Subagent tasks allocated
```

#### Phase 2: Structured Execution
```
EXECUTION PROTOCOL:
□ Start fresh session with documented plan
□ Use @ file references for specific context
□ Implement in chunks fitting within context limits
□ Run validation through separate subagent
□ Update documentation before context switches
```

### 6.2 Quality Standards

#### Success Indicators
- ✅ Subagents complete tasks and return specific file paths modified
- ✅ Tests pass in blind validation by separate agent
- ✅ Context usage stays manageable before quality checks
- ✅ Each session has single, focused objective  
- ✅ Documentation updates happen before context switches

#### Failure Warning Signs
- ❌ "Let me search through your entire codebase" (unfocused scope)
- ❌ Context at 90% with "10% remaining" warnings
- ❌ Multiple unrelated tasks in same conversation
- ❌ No verification beyond "I've completed the task"
- ❌ Creating duplicate functionality instead of refactoring

## 7. Advanced Integration Patterns

### 7.1 MCP Integration (Missing from Original)

Model Context Protocol extends Claude Code's capabilities significantly:

```bash
# Configure MCP servers for external data
/mcp  # View and manage MCP connections

# Example integrations:
# - Google Drive for design docs
# - Jira for ticket management  
# - GitHub for repository data
# - Custom internal tools
```

### 7.2 Git Worktrees for Parallel Work

```bash
# Create isolated workspaces for parallel Claude sessions
git worktree add ../project-feature-a -b feature-a
git worktree add ../project-bugfix -b bugfix-123

# Run Claude Code in each worktree independently
cd ../project-feature-a && claude
cd ../project-bugfix && claude
```

### 7.3 Extended Thinking Integration

```bash
# Trigger appropriate thinking levels for task complexity
> think about the best approach for implementing OAuth2       # Basic thinking
> think harder about potential security vulnerabilities       # Deeper analysis
> think longer about architectural implications              # Extended analysis

# Use thinking strategically:
# - Complex architectural decisions: Extended thinking
# - Bug debugging: Medium thinking
# - Simple tasks: Minimal thinking
```

## 8. Security and Safety Excellence

### 8.1 Security-First Principles

#### Permission Configuration (Not YOLO Mode)
```bash
# ❌ DANGEROUS: --dangerously-skip-permissions
# ✅ SECURE: Thoughtful permission configuration

# Configure project-specific permissions
/permissions

# Set up allowlists for safe, common operations:
# - Approved bash commands (git, npm, pytest)
# - Specific file operations
# - Testing and build commands
```

#### Trust But Verify Pattern
```
Implementation Agent: "I've implemented the authentication"
Validation Agent: "I'll verify WITHOUT seeing implementation details"
├── Run test suite
├── Check functionality 
├── Take screenshots
└── Report objective results
```

### 8.2 Safe Development Practices

#### Working with Untrusted Content
1. **Always use Plan Mode** for initial exploration
2. **Review all suggested commands** before approval
3. **Verify proposed changes** to critical files
4. **Use virtual machines** when working with external services
5. **Report suspicious behavior** with `/bug`

#### Team Security Guidelines
- Use enterprise managed policies for organizational standards
- Share approved permission configurations through version control
- Train team members on security best practices
- Monitor usage through OpenTelemetry metrics

## 9. Performance and Efficiency Optimization

### 9.1 Context Optimization

#### Built-in Tools
```bash
/compact                    # Manual context compression
/cost                      # Monitor token usage
/memory                    # Edit memory files efficiently
```

#### Proactive Context Management
- Monitor context usage continuously
- Plan handoffs before 50% usage (heuristic)
- Use auto-compact features when available
- Leverage memory files for persistent state

### 9.2 Search and Discovery Optimization

#### Official Tools (Prefer These)
```bash
# Fast, optimized search capabilities
# Glob: Pattern matching for any codebase size
# Grep: Powerful search with ripgrep backend

# Example usage:
> Find all authentication-related files
> Search for JWT validation logic in auth services
> Locate files matching "**/*.config.js"
```

#### Project Index Pattern (Advanced Alternative)
*Only implement if official tools prove insufficient for very large codebases:*

```json
// PROJECT_INDEX.json - Maintained via hooks
{
  "files": {
    "src/auth/login.ts": {
      "imports": ["jwt", "crypto"],
      "exports": ["validateLogin", "generateToken"], 
      "dependencies": ["src/models/User.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Assessment:** High maintenance overhead. Start with official tools first.

## 10. Workflow Templates

### 10.1 New Feature Implementation

```bash
# 1. Safe exploration
claude --permission-mode plan
> Analyze requirements for implementing user authentication
> Think deeply about security implications and integration points  
> Create detailed implementation plan

# 2. Implementation with validation
claude --continue  
> Implement Phase 1: User model and database schema
> /agents  # Use blind-validator subagent to verify

# 3. Iterative development
> Continue with Phase 2: Login endpoint implementation
> Validate with separate agent again
```

### 10.2 Bug Investigation and Resolution

```bash
# 1. Problem analysis
claude --permission-mode plan
> Investigate this error: [paste error message]
> Analyze recent changes that might have caused this
> Create debugging strategy

# 2. Implementation
claude --continue
> Apply fix based on analysis
> Create regression tests
> Validate fix with blind validator subagent
```

### 10.3 Code Review and Refactoring

```bash
# 1. Analysis phase
/agents  # Create/use code-reviewer subagent
> Review authentication module for security and maintainability
> Identify refactoring opportunities

# 2. Refactoring execution  
> Implement suggested improvements incrementally
> Run tests after each change
> Use validation subagent for final review
```
