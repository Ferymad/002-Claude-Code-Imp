- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some technical claims require verification
- ‚ùå Several missing official features and capabilities
- üîÑ Mixed alignment with official security recommendations

---

## 1. Technical Accuracy Audit

### 1.1 Context Window and Token Claims

#### Claim: "200K token context window"
**Status:** ‚úÖ **ACCURATE**
- **Evidence:** Official documentation confirms Claude Code uses Claude 3.5 models with 200K context windows
- **Source:** Multiple official docs reference the 200K limit

#### Claim: "After ~50% context usage, output quality falls off a cliff"
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIALLY SUPPORTED**
- **Evidence:** The prompt cites "Chroma DB study" but official docs don't specify exact percentage
- **Official Guidance:** Docs recommend using `/compact` when context gets full, mention "auto compact" feature
- **Assessment:** The general principle is correct, but the specific 50% threshold is not officially documented

#### Claim: "Ultra think uses 32,000 tokens"
**Status:** ‚úÖ **LIKELY ACCURATE**
- **Evidence:** Video transcript mentions specific token allocations: 32K, 16K, 8K, 4K for different thinking modes
- **Official Source:** Extended thinking documentation mentions varying levels but doesn't specify exact tokens
- **Assessment:** Consistent with user reports but not officially documented

#### Claim: "Context rot in a funny way"
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CITATION NEEDED**
- **Issue:** Specific Chroma DB study citation is not verifiable in official docs
- **Principle:** Generally supported by official guidance on context management

### 1.2 Feature Implementation Claims

#### Claim: "Subagents get fresh 200K contexts - no inheritance"
**Status:** ‚úÖ **ACCURATE**
- **Evidence:** Official subagent docs state "Each subagent uses its own context window separate from the main conversation"
- **Verification:** "Each subagent operates in its own context, preventing pollution of the main conversation"

#### Claim: "Hooks operate outside Claude's lifecycle"
**Status:** ‚úÖ **ACCURATE**
- **Evidence:** Official hooks docs confirm "hooks exist outside of the lifecycle"
- **Quote:** "Claude itself, the context you're talking to doesn't know about it"

#### Claim: "Slash commands have higher priority than claude.md"
**Status:** ‚ùì **NEEDS VERIFICATION**
- **Evidence:** Not explicitly stated in official docs
- **Assessment:** User experience claim requiring testing

## 2. Best Practice Alignment Analysis

### 2.1 Workflow Comparison

#### Mastery Prompt Approach vs Official Common Workflows

| Aspect | Mastery Prompt | Official Docs | Alignment |
|--------|----------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Planning Emphasis** | 60-70% of effort | Not specified | ‚ö†Ô∏è No official guidance |
| **Context Preservation** | Clear and preserve state | `/compact` and memory files | ‚úÖ Aligned |
| **Verification** | Blind validation pattern | Test-driven approach | ‚úÖ Compatible |
| **Multi-session work** | Context relay race | `--continue` and `--resume` | üîÑ Different approaches |

#### Planning Phase Analysis
**Mastery Claim:** "60-70% of effort" should be planning
**Official Guidance:** Emphasizes planning but no specific percentage
**Assessment:** Strong principle but unsupported by official metrics

### 2.2 Security Assessment

#### YOLO Mode Recommendation
**Mastery Approach:** "Alias 'c' ‚Üí claude --dangerously-skip-permissions"
**Official Security Stance:** Permission-based architecture, explicit approval by design
**Risk Level:** üî¥ **HIGH RISK**

**Detailed Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ **User acknowledges risk:** "YOLO mode for trusted environments"
- ‚ùå **Contradicts official security model:** Designed for explicit permission
- ‚ùå **Enterprise concerns:** Not suitable for team/organizational use
- **Official Alternative:** Configure specific permissions via `/permissions`

#### Blind Validation Pattern
**Security Assessment:** ‚úÖ **EXCELLENT SECURITY PRACTICE**
- Aligns with "trust but verify" principle
- Prevents confirmation bias
- Matches official emphasis on testing

## 3. Missing Official Features Analysis

### 3.1 Major Omissions in Mastery Prompt

#### Plan Mode
**Status:** üö® **CRITICAL OMISSION**
- **Official Feature:** `--permission-mode plan` for safe exploration
- **Use Cases:** Multi-step planning, code exploration, research
- **Impact:** Mastery prompt doesn't mention this key safety feature

#### MCP Integration
**Status:** üö® **MAJOR GAP**
- **Official Capability:** Model Context Protocol for external data
- **Significance:** Major integration feature completely missing
- **Impact:** Incomplete picture of Claude Code capabilities

#### Resume/Continue Sessions
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **WORKFLOW GAP**
- **Official Features:** `--continue` and `--resume` commands
- **Mastery Alternative:** "Context relay race" manual approach
- **Efficiency:** Official approach is more streamlined

#### @ File References
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CONVENIENCE OMISSION**
- **Official Feature:** `@path/to/file` for instant file inclusion
- **Mastery Gap:** Doesn't mention this efficient referencing method

### 3.2 Recently Added Features

#### Native Installation
**Status:** Currently in beta, not mentioned in mastery prompt
#### Updated Permission Model
**Status:** New features may not be reflected

## 4. Advanced Pattern Evaluation

### 4.1 Project Index Method Deep Dive

#### Technical Analysis
**Concept:** "Minified representation of entire codebase"
**Implementation:** "Updated via hook on every file change"

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ Addresses real problem of context limitation
- ‚úÖ Innovative approach to codebase navigation
- ‚úÖ Leverages hooks effectively

**Concerns:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Maintenance overhead: Constant index updates
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance: File system watching implications
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Accuracy: Minified representation may miss context
- ‚ùì Comparison: Official Glob/Grep tools may be more efficient

**Official Alternative Analysis:**
- **Glob tool:** Fast pattern matching for any codebase size
- **Grep tool:** Powerful search with ripgrep backend
- **Assessment:** Official tools may provide better performance/simplicity ratio

### 4.2 Blind Validator Pattern Assessment

#### Pattern Analysis
**Concept:** "Never let the builder validate their own work"
**Implementation:** Separate subagent for validation without seeing implementation plan

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ Excellent software engineering practice
- ‚úÖ Prevents confirmation bias
- ‚úÖ Aligns with testing best practices
- ‚úÖ Uses subagent architecture effectively

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Resource usage: Multiple agent contexts
- Coordination complexity: Managing handoffs
- Official alignment: Compatible with subagent best practices

## 5. Workflow Efficiency Analysis

### 5.1 Planning vs Execution Balance

#### Mastery Claim: 60-70% Planning
**Evidence Base:** User experience from video transcript
**Official Support:** No specific percentages in documentation
**Assessment:** 
- ‚úÖ Strong principle: Planning prevents rework
- ‚ùì Specific percentages: Not validated
- üîÑ Context-dependent: May vary by task complexity

### 5.2 Context Management Strategies

#### Mastery Approach: "Context Relay Race"
```
Session 1: Research and planning ‚Üí docs/next-steps.md
[CLEAR]
Session 2: Read docs ‚Üí Implementation chunk 1 ‚Üí docs/next-steps.md
[CLEAR]
Session 3: Read docs ‚Üí Implementation chunk 2 ‚Üí validation
```

#### Official Alternatives:
1. **Auto-compact:** Automatic context management
2. **Continue/Resume:** `--continue` and `--resume` for session management
3. **Memory files:** CLAUDE.md for persistent information

**Comparison:**
- Mastery approach: More manual, explicit control
- Official approach: More automated, streamlined
- Both valid: Different philosophies on control vs convenience

## 6. Potential Inaccuracies and Misconceptions

### 6.1 Documented Inaccuracies

#### "Documentation Overhead" Claim
**Mastery Statement:** "Every time Claude needs to check its capabilities, it does expensive web fetches"
**Reality Check:** ‚ùå **INACCURATE**
- **Official Capability:** "Claude has built-in access to its documentation"
- **Evidence:** "Claude always has access to the latest Claude Code documentation, regardless of the version you're using"
- **Local docs benefit:** Still valuable for offline/faster access

### 6.2 Potentially Misleading Guidance

#### Command Alias Recommendations
**Safety Concern:** Keyboard shortcuts ('u' ‚Üí 'ultra think') may lead to accidental expensive operations
**Risk Mitigation:** User awareness and cost monitoring needed
