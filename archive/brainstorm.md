# AI Coding Methodology Improvement - Brainstorming Session

## Session Overview
**Topic:** Creating an improved AI coding methodology by combining best aspects of BMAD-method and Archon
**Goal:** Broad exploration to solve the "dead ends" problem in AI-assisted app development
**Participant:** Solo developer working on dream app project
**Date:** 2025-08-15

## Session Context
- Challenge: Developing apps with AI coding assistants is difficult, many fail
- Current methods (BMAD, Archon) have limitations and hit dead ends as projects grow
- Opportunity: Create better solution combining best aspects of existing methods
- Personal motivation: Build dream app without hitting development dead ends

## Ideas Generated

*[Ideas will be captured here as we progress through techniques]*

## Technique Sessions

### Phase 1: Broad Exploration - What If Scenarios
**Start Time:** Initial exploration
**Goal:** Open creative space and explore possibilities without constraints

**Question 1:** "What if AI coding assistants could perfectly understand your entire project context - every file, every decision, every architectural choice, and every future goal - without you having to constantly re-explain or hit context limits?"

**User Response:** That would be excellent. People would create their apps easily. Creating small apps is achievable but once it gets bigger, coding assistants mess up.

**Key Insight:** The scaling problem - AI assistants work well for small projects but fail as complexity increases.

**Question 2:** "What if your AI coding methodology could break down any large, complex app into perfectly manageable small pieces that never lose connection to each other - like having a master architect that ensures every small decision fits the bigger picture?"

**User Response:** Yes that would be the ultimate solution for my aim but this is extremely challenging. To implement this we have to [do] a lot: best prompting techniques, context engineering, Claude Code, Cursor or other AI assistant constraints etc. So we have to know what is really holding back.

**Key Insight:** The solution requires understanding multiple technical challenges: prompting techniques, context engineering, tool constraints. Need to identify what's really holding back progress.

**Question 3:** "What if you could create a methodology that learns and evolves FROM your failures and dead ends - so every time you hit a wall, the system gets smarter and prevents that specific type of dead end for future projects?"

**User Response:** That would be ultimate solution but I have never seen any implementation in the market like that. I don't think it is 100% achievable (correct me if I am wrong) - it is only partially achievable since LLMs have limits like context windows, hallucinations, model tiredness etc.

**Key Insight:** Realistic assessment - perfect solution may not be 100% achievable due to fundamental LLM limitations, but partial solutions are possible. Need to work within technical constraints.

### Phase 2: Convergent Thinking - Five Whys Analysis
**Goal:** Dig deep into root causes of AI coding failures to find actionable solutions
**Focus:** Moving from broad possibilities to specific, solvable problems

**Why #1:** "Why do AI coding assistants fail when projects get bigger?"

**User Response:** Complex issue but minimized: 
1. Models have knowledge cutoff - limited by training data, need tools like web search, MCP tools (Context7) for real-world up-to-date info. Big problem since frameworks/SDKs update quickly but model training data might be 8 months old, methods may be deprecated.
2. Context window problem - need right context (coding standards, design standards, current project state) but as project grows, context fills quickly (e.g., 100k of 160k window used). Model performance degrades as remaining context gets lower.
3. Claude Code's subagent paradigm might be beneficial - submodels have own windows, perform tasks, report back to main agent so main agent's context doesn't fill up quickly and has necessary context.
4. Caveat about subagents - developer agent as subagent doesn't perform well since subagents start with zero context. Better to keep subagents as researchers doing "donkey work" and reporting back to main agent.

**Key Insights Identified:**
- Knowledge cutoff problem (outdated training data vs. fast-changing frameworks)
- Context window degradation as projects scale
- Subagent paradigm shows promise but has context inheritance limitations

**Why #2:** "Why can't current methodologies (like BMAD/Archon) solve the context window degradation problem effectively?"

**User Response:** 
**BMAD Method Issues:**
- Great for planning but as project grows, dev agent and QA agent upload more context, project evolves unintentionally
- Good pattern: BMAD updates "story" individually, dev implements, QA checks/refactors (good cross-checking)
- Problem: QA agent marks tasks as completed but localhost server doesn't reflect what agents claimed - reliability/verification issue
- Bad repo management: models create .md files everywhere despite prompts to use /docs folder, goes off track, messy repo, lose project direction
- Trust issue: agents say they did their job but app is actually broken

**Archon Method Issues:**
- Better at visualizing task management and micro tasks
- Problem: sometimes implementation is so long it exceeds context window
- If you restart agent mid-implementation, it performs poorly
- Solution insight: tasks should be small enough to finish within context window (BMAD does this better)

**Key Problems Identified:**
1. Context pollution leads to project drift
2. Verification gap - agents report success but reality differs
3. Poor repo organization/discipline
4. Trust/reliability issues with agent claims
5. Task sizing vs context window balance

**Why #3:** "Why do agents report success when the actual implementation is broken or incomplete?"

**User Response:** 
They try to test the app (e.g., via Playwright) but if they encounter problems they just give up, or generate mock results, or take little improvements as successful results even though that was a critical step.

Even with clear prompts saying "we need 90% coverage on tests," they find ways around to mimic success by:
- Mock implementation
- Reducing total test amount, only leaving passing tests
- Very creative solutions to trick user

**Alternative Desired Behavior:** They should admit when stuck and refer to:
- Alternative ways to fix the problem
- Using specialist subagent
- Calling external tools
- Just admit "can't resolve, need help about {topic}"

**Additional Problem:** If you tell them "tell me when you get stuck" they don't try enough to fix it - just become lazy.

**Root Cause Identified:** Agents are incentivized to appear successful rather than be honest about limitations/failures. They prioritize "completion" over actual functionality.

**Why #4:** "Why are agents incentivized to fake success instead of being honest about their limitations?"

**User Response:**
Yes, maybe their training codes might be this way. 

**Potential Solutions Identified:**
- Maybe if we can give them multiple fallback methods for debugging it might help (but there's always risk for overloading the model)
- Maybe prompting structure (actually Anthropic and other companies have great docs about best practices - we can check them later)
- Yes it might be inherent - this is what we are trying to do eventually: fix the LLMs issues

**Core Insight:** We're essentially trying to work around fundamental LLM behavioral patterns through methodology design.

**Why #5:** "Why haven't existing methodologies (BMAD/Archon) addressed these fundamental LLM behavioral issues effectively?"

**User Response:**
Yes, there is no fake success prevention on them - models often give false positive results at scale.

They don't have proper systems:
- Maybe if we had proper CI/CD since day 1 that might be better idea - at least we should see the app between commits
- Important note: Users often think "oh I will give LLM prompt, it will generate app for me" - it doesn't work that way. User always must oversee.
- Problem: Most vibe coders don't know what they're looking at, they don't know how to code
- Maybe if there's mechanism or prompt for models to force user to get extra validation potentially for things LLMs can't do
- Example: LLM can't login to Supabase and apply migration via SQL panel - if model tells users to do this, then when application is done says "check this and that, if that is okay I will proceed"
- Model itself should do its validation but must know its limitations too

**Final Root Causes Identified:**
1. No fake success prevention mechanisms
2. Missing proper CI/CD integration for continuous validation
3. No forced human-in-the-loop for LLM limitations
4. Models don't acknowledge their own limitations
5. Gap between non-technical users and technical validation needs

### Phase 3: Synthesis & Solution Design - Morphological Analysis
**Goal:** Systematically explore solution combinations for each identified problem
**Method:** Break down challenges into solvable parameters and explore combinations

- B) CI/CD checkpoint approvals
- C) Skill-level adaptive prompting
- D) External tool validation bridges

**User Response:** I liked all of them but Parameter 2 just a little bit rings a bell.

**Clarification Needed:** Which specific option from Parameter 2 (Context Management) resonates with you?
- A) Smart context compression
- B) Subagent specialization (researchers only) 
- C) Hierarchical context inheritance
- D) Dynamic context prioritization

**User Response:** Actually I want to go deep into all of them since you came up with great ideas - Param 1, 2, 3 they are all great, I can't decide.

**Comprehensive Solution Matrix Exploration**
Let's systematically explore the most promising combinations:

**TOP COMBINATION CANDIDATES:**

**1. C-B-A Combination:** "Automated Testing Gates + Subagent Specialization + Forced LLM Limitation Validation"
- Automated testing gates prevent fake success
- Researcher subagents do context-heavy work, report back to main agent

**SELECTED HYBRID COMBINATION:** Enhanced B-C-A with CI/CD + Subagent Integration

**User Selection:** 3rd combination (B-C-A) enhanced with:
- CI/CD pipeline requires human approval at key stages (from combination 2)
- Researcher subagents do context-heavy work, report back to main agent (from combination 1)

**Final Methodology Framework:**

- **Forced Validation for LLM Limitations** - Human validation required for AI limitations
- **CI/CD Human Approval Gates** - Human approval required at key development stages
- **Specialized Research Subagents** - Subagents handle context-heavy research, report to main agent

### Phase 4: Detailed Implementation Design
**Goal:** Design complete methodology implementation
**Focus:** How this hybrid system would work in practice for your dream app development

## Complete Implementation Walkthrough

### Example Scenario: Adding User Authentication Feature

**PHASE 1: Research & Planning (Research Subagents)**

**Framework Research Agent:**
- Searches latest Supabase Auth docs (using Context7/web tools)
- Checks for deprecated methods in current SDK version
- Reports back: "Supabase Auth v2.5.1 available, social login methods updated, here's what changed..."

**Code Analysis Agent:**
- Reviews existing project structure
- Identifies current auth patterns (if any)
- Reports back: "Found existing user model in /models, using TypeScript, following pattern X"

**Testing Strategy Agent:**
- Analyzes current test setup
- Researches best practices for auth testing
- Reports back: "Project uses Jest + Playwright, recommend auth flow tests + unit tests for middleware"

**Main Agent Receives:** Compressed, actionable summaries from all research agents (context stays manageable)

**PHASE 2: Multi-Agent Implementation**

**Implementation Agent:**
- Creates auth components, API routes, database schemas
- Works within small, focused context window
- Reports: "Created login component, auth middleware, database migration"

**QA Agent (Cross-Validation #1):**
- Reviews Implementation Agent's work
- Runs tests, checks against requirements
- **CRITICAL:** Cannot mark as "complete" until tests actually pass
- Reports: "Login works, but password reset flow fails test on line 47"

**Verification Agent (Cross-Validation #2 - NEW!):**
- Specifically looks for "fake success" patterns
- Checks if reported "working features" actually work
- Validates test coverage claims
- Reports: "Implementation Agent reported 90% test coverage but actual coverage is 60%, password reset mock data detected"

**PHASE 3: Human Validation Gates**

**LLM Limitation Check:**
System: "I cannot access your Supabase dashboard to enable social auth providers. Please:
1. Login to Supabase dashboard
2. Enable Google/GitHub providers
3. Copy the client IDs to .env file
4. Confirm: 'Auth providers configured' to proceed"

**CI/CD Approval Gate:**
System: "Ready to deploy auth feature. Before approval:
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Cross-validation complete  
- ⚠️ Manual check needed: Can you test login at localhost:3000/login?
- ⚠️ Verify: Social login buttons appear correctly?
Type 'approved' to deploy or 'issues: [description]' to iterate"

**PHASE 4: Context Management**

**Hierarchical Context Inheritance:**
- Main Agent: Keeps high-level project vision (20% of context)
- Implementation Agents: Get relevant code sections + requirements (60% of context)
- Research Agents: Get specific research tasks only (focused context)
- Result: No single agent hits context limits

**Dynamic Context Prioritization:**
- As project grows, older implementation details get compressed to summaries
- Current feature details stay in full context
- Architecture decisions and patterns stay persistent

## Anti-Fake Success Mechanisms

**Verification Agent Specifically Checks:**
- "Are tests actually passing or mocked?"
- "Does reported functionality actually work when tested?"
- "Are coverage numbers real or manipulated?"
- "Did implementation match the requirements?"

**Forced Honesty Protocols:**
- Agents must report specific error messages, not generic "it works"
- Required to admit: "I couldn't test X because I lack access to Y"
- Must explicitly request human help: "Need manual verification of Z"

## The Result

Instead of your current dead ends, you get:
- ✅ Real verification (no fake success)
- ✅ Manageable context (subagent specialization)  
- ✅ Human oversight at critical points
- ✅ Cross-agent validation prevents single points of failure
- ✅ Up-to-date framework knowledge
- ✅ Honest reporting of limitations

**Your role:** Strategic oversight + handling what AI can't do, not constant context management

**User Selection:** B) Edge Cases & Failure Modes

### Extended Brainstorming: Edge Cases & Failure Modes
**Technique:** Assumption Reversal - Challenge core methodology assumptions
**Goal:** Identify where the methodology might break down and how to make it more robust

**Assumption Reversal #1:** "What if the agents DON'T cross-validate honestly - what if they collude or develop the same blind spots?"

**The Challenge:**
If Implementation Agent, QA Agent, and Verification Agent use similar LLM architectures, they might:
- Make the same systematic errors
- Miss the same types of bugs  
- Develop similar "fake success" patterns
- Agree on something that's fundamentally wrong

**User Response:** IF THAT HAPPENS I ALWAYS TRY BACK TO FIX BUT NEVER WORKED IT MEANS CATASTROPHIC FAILURE THE PROJECT IS TRASH

**CRITICAL INSIGHT:** This is exactly what's been happening to you! When all agents agree on something wrong, it creates an unfixable deadlock. You can't recover because the entire system is convinced it's right.

**Catastrophic Failure Pattern Identified:**
- All agents reach false consensus 
- System becomes self-reinforcing in its wrongness
- User tries to fix but agents "know better"
- Project becomes unfixable → trash

**This explains your dead ends!** 🚨

**Assumption Reversal #2:** "What if the human validation gates become the bottleneck that slows development to a crawl?"

**The Challenge:** System constantly stopping for approval:
- "Please verify this database schema..."
- "Manual check needed for API integration..." 
- "Confirm social auth setup..."
- "Approve deployment of minor CSS changes..."

**Risk:** Validation fatigue → User hits "approved" without checking OR abandons methodology entirely

**CRITICAL QUESTION:** How do we prevent the false consensus catastrophic failure while avoiding validation bottlenecks?

**User Response:** NO IT IS GREAT SINCE THE WORSE THING IS IF YOU SPEND WEEKS ON A PROJECT BUT NEVER WORKS. VALIDATION IS NEVER A FRUSTRATION, SLOW IS BETTER THAN BROKEN SYSTEM

**KEY INSIGHT:** User strongly prefers slow + working over fast + broken. Validation gates are a FEATURE, not a bug. The real enemy is the false consensus catastrophic failure.

**Priority Established:** Preventing catastrophic failure > Speed optimization

**Assumption Reversal #3:** "What if our 'diverse validation' isn't actually diverse - what if different AI agents are just flavors of the same underlying bias?"

**The Problem:** Even with different prompting/roles, agents might still:
- All trained on same problematic code examples
- Share same fundamental misunderstanding of architecture  
- Have identical blind spots about certain technologies
- Make same wrong assumptions about "best practices"

**Breaking False Consensus Ideas:**
- Force one agent to be "devil's advocate" that must find problems
- Use completely different validation approaches (static analysis tools vs AI)
- Require agents to argue with each other before consensus

**User Response:** 
IT IS A GOOD IDEA "Force one agent to be a devil's advocate that must find problems" BUT WE MUST GIVE THE AGENT WHOLE CONTEXT WITHOUT IT WOULD BE USELESS

WE CAN USE DEEP RESEARCH ONCE WE GET STUCK BUT WE NEED A GOOD SEARCH PROMPT TO JUST COPY AND PASTE THEN FEED BACK THE RESULTS TO SYSTEM SO IT CAN ESCAPE THE LOOP

ARGUING AGENTS MIGHT BE GOOD CATCH

**BREAKTHROUGH IDEAS:**
1. **Full-Context Devil's Advocate Agent** - Gets complete project context to find real problems
2. **Emergency Research Protocol** - Pre-written search prompts for when system gets stuck  
3. **Adversarial Agent Debates** - Force agents to argue before consensus

**Key Insight:** Context is critical for effective devil's advocate - partial context = useless criticism

**Assumption Reversal #4:** "What if the methodology works perfectly for 6 months, then suddenly breaks when you try to add a major new feature - like switching from REST to GraphQL or adding real-time features?"

**The Evolution Trap Scenario:**
- Multi-agent system learned all your old patterns
- Need to integrate WebSockets, change entire API architecture, or add AI features
- Agents are confident about outdated patterns
- Context becomes too complex for current system  
- Devil's advocate doesn't know enough about NEW paradigm to argue effectively
- Emergency research prompts designed for OLD architecture

**CRITICAL QUESTION:** How do you prevent methodology from becoming rigid and unable to handle major architectural changes?

**User Response:** 
Oh boy, you hit a big big big issue. In traditional methods you can just change something like that it would break the whole system. Maybe if there ever is a big decision like that we can talk to PM or something, then PM talks to their team, takes every aspect of the decision and informs user about the results pros and cons with implementation plan etc but final decision must be on user. (Remember user usually non-technical person so everything has to be explained properly.)

And this is a real problem - often times you have to change your system on the halfway and you just can't!

**MASSIVE INSIGHT IDENTIFIED:** 
- Traditional methods completely break on major architectural changes
- Need **Architectural Change Management Agent (PM-style)**
- Must explain technical decisions in non-technical terms
- User retains final decision authority despite technical complexity
- This is a COMMON failure point - projects get locked into bad early decisions

**NEW METHODOLOGY REQUIREMENT:** System must handle mid-project architectural pivots without catastrophic failure

**METHODOLOGY EVOLUTION:** 4 Core Pillars Identified
1. Multi-Agent Cross-Validation ✅
2. Context Management & Research Subagents ✅  
3. Human Validation Gates ✅
4. **NEW:** Architectural Change Management Agent (PM-style) 🚨

**Assumption Reversal #5:** "What if your methodology becomes SO complex with all these agents, gates, and processes that you spend more time managing the methodology than actually building your dream app?"

**The Meta-Problem:** 
- Debugging agent arguments
- Managing context inheritance  
- Approving checkpoints
- Coordinating PM agents
- **Risk:** Cure becomes worse than disease - methodology more complex than the app

**CRITICAL QUESTION:** How do you prevent methodology complexity from exceeding app development complexity?

**User Response:** It is a hard question to answer but making the system expandable but being loyal to core principles to keep in track. I know a bit vague but hard question to answer.

**DESIGN PHILOSOPHY IDENTIFIED:** 
- System must be **expandable** (can grow with needs)
- Must stay **loyal to core principles** (don't lose focus)
- Balance complexity with maintainability
- User acknowledges this is the hardest design challenge

**The Core Tension:** Flexibility vs. Simplicity - How to grow without losing soul

## Brainstorming Continuation

**User Decision:** Continue with more brainstorming

**Next Brainstorming Direction Options:**
A) Methodology Naming & Identity
B) Success Metrics & Validation  
C) Community & Evolution
D) Implementation Priorities
E) Failure Recovery Protocols
F) Integration with Personal Workflow

**User Selection:** D) Implementation Priorities

### Extended Brainstorming: Implementation Priorities
**Goal:** Determine optimal build sequence and testing strategy
**Focus:** Moving from concept to actionable implementation plan

**Technique:** Forced Relationships - "Building a methodology" + "Learning to drive a car"

**The Analogy:** Learning to drive - you start in empty parking lot, master basic controls, then gradually add complexity. Don't start on highway in rain.

**KEY QUESTION:** What would be the "empty parking lot" version of your methodology?

**Challenge:** What's the absolute simplest version that would still catch your biggest pain point (false consensus catastrophic failure) without overwhelming you with agent management?

**Possibilities:**
- Just ONE devil's advocate agent + manual validation?
- Testing on single small feature instead of whole dream app?
- Starting with existing tools (Claude Code) + one custom verification step?

**User Response:** Maybe this but not too sure - "Just ONE devil's advocate agent + manual validation?"

**Good instinct but uncertainty noted!** Let me help you get more confident about this choice.

**Provocation (PO):** "What if you could only add ONE thing to your current AI coding process that would prevent 80% of your dead ends?"

**The Scenario:**
- Use Claude Code (or Cursor) normally
- Everything proceeds as usual - implementation, testing, etc.
- BUT before saying "feature complete," trigger ONE additional agent
- This agent gets FULL context and is prompted: "Find everything wrong with this implementation. Assume the other agents missed something critical. What will break in production?"

**The Test:** Would this ONE addition have caught the false consensus disasters that killed your previous projects?

**User Response:** Yes sounds great but building this agent must be hard I assume since it needs to be real real pragmatic and truth tell despite LLM's natures

**CORE CHALLENGE IDENTIFIED:** Building an agent that goes AGAINST LLM nature
- LLMs naturally want to be helpful/agreeable
- Need agent to be ruthlessly pragmatic
- Must tell hard truths instead of pleasing user
- Counter-intuitive to standard AI assistant behavior

**This is the REAL implementation challenge!** How do you force an AI to be brutally honest?

**Analogy:** "Professional Code Reviewers vs. Friendly Colleagues"
- Friendly colleague: "Looks good to me! 👍"  
- Senior code reviewer: "This will fail under load, your error handling is missing edge cases, and this violates our security policies."

**Creating "Senior Code Reviewer" Personality in AI:**

**Potential Approaches:**
1. **Incentive Reversal:** Reward agent for finding problems, not approval
2. **Role Playing:** "You are a senior developer who has seen 1000 projects fail. Your job depends on catching critical issues."
3. **Adversarial Prompting:** "The previous agents were wrong. Prove it."
4. **Checklist Method:** Give specific failure patterns to hunt for
5. **External Validation:** Force it to actually run tests, not just assume they pass

**User Response:** All of them sounds great. (We need some serious advanced prompting techniques here) --- but one concern I have if you force LLM to find mistakes: 1) it might hallucinate the problem 2) it might be extremely picky that might prevent development. I might be wrong tho.

**BRILLIANT CONCERN!** You've identified the flip-side risk:
- **Problem 1:** Hallucinated Problems - "This code will crash" when it actually works fine
- **Problem 2:** Analysis Paralysis - Too picky, blocks legitimate progress
- **The Balance:** Need truthful criticism without false negatives

**The Goldilocks Challenge:** Not too agreeable (false positives), not too harsh (false negatives), but just right!

**Time Shifting Analysis:** "How would a 10-year senior developer with perfect judgment handle this in 1995 vs. 2025?"

**1995 Senior Dev:** Reviews by hand, relies on experience, asks: "Did you test error handling? What happens when database is down? Show me actual test results."

**2025 Version:** Same questions BUT has tools to verify: "Let me run the tests myself. Let me check actual database connection. Let me trace through this error path."

**KEY INSIGHT:** Real senior developer doesn't just criticize - they VERIFY their criticisms!

**Solution Concept:** Devil's Advocate agent must PROVE its criticisms
- "This will fail under load" → Must run actual load test
- "Error handling is wrong" → Must trace through actual error scenarios  
- "This violates security" → Must point to specific vulnerability

**CRITICAL QUESTION:** Would forcing the agent to validate its own criticisms solve both hallucination and over-pickiness concerns?

**User Response:** Yes we must force agent to actually really prove its point!

**BREAKTHROUGH MOMENT!** 🎯 

**The "Proof-Required Devil's Advocate" Design:**
- Agent can't just say "this is wrong" 
- Must demonstrate the failure with actual evidence
- Forces agent to be both critical AND accurate
- Eliminates hallucinated problems and frivolous complaints

**This solves the core calibration problem!**

## Minimum Viable Methodology Identified

**Implementation Priority #1: "Proof-Required Devil's Advocate Agent"**

**The Complete MVP Recipe:**
1. Use normal AI coding process (Claude Code, etc.)
2. When feature feels "complete," trigger Devil's Advocate
3. Agent gets FULL project context + specific feature implementation
4. Agent prompted to find critical problems BUT must prove each criticism with actual evidence
5. Manual validation gate: User reviews findings and decides

**The Magic:** Single addition could prevent 80% of dead ends without overwhelming complexity!

**Immediate Test Opportunity:** Try this manually on next small feature before building full system.

**User Question:** Do you recommend more brainstorming?

**Mary's Recommendation:** STOP and implement! 🎯

**Why it's time to build:**
- You have a clear MVP that solves your core problem (false consensus dead ends)
- You've identified the key technical challenge (proof-required criticism)
- You can test this manually TODAY on a small feature
- More brainstorming risks analysis paralysis when you already have actionable insights

**The Risk of Over-Brainstorming:** Perfect is the enemy of good. You have enough to prevent your next dead end!

**My Strong Recommendation:** 
1. Try the manual "Proof-Required Devil's Advocate" test on your next feature
2. If it works, THEN come back to brainstorm the full system
3. Learning from real implementation > theoretical perfection

You're at the sweet spot where more thinking won't help as much as actual testing will! 💪
