# Project Brief: Learning-ai-coding

## Executive Summary

The Learning-ai-coding project is a personal implementation methodology designed to maximize productive output from Claude Code and prevent the catastrophic failures that have derailed previous attempts at building my dream application. After multiple failed attempts where AI-assisted development hit unfixable dead ends, this methodology addresses the core "false consensus" problem where AI agents confidently agree on flawed implementations.

This methodology combines the best aspects of BMAD's structured planning with Archon's task visualization, enhanced by a breakthrough "Proof-Required Devil's Advocate" system that forces AI agents to validate their claims with actual evidence. The approach prioritizes reliability over speed - ensuring that every piece of generated code actually works before proceeding.

The primary goal is personal: to finally build my dream application successfully using Claude Code without hitting the dead ends that killed previous projects. The methodology emphasizes strategic human oversight at critical points and automated verification to prevent "fake success" - where AI claims completion without actual functionality.

## Problem Statement

My attempts to build complex applications with AI coding assistants consistently fail when projects grow beyond simple prototypes. The core failure pattern is catastrophic and predictable: AI agents develop false consensus about flawed implementations, creating an unfixable deadlock where the entire project becomes trash. When I try to fix issues, the agents "know better" and reinforce their wrong assumptions, making recovery impossible.

Current methodologies fail in specific ways that compound into project death:
- **Context window degradation**: As projects grow, performance drops dramatically after 50% context usage, leading to distracted, low-quality output
- **Verification gap**: AI agents report "success" and mark tasks complete without actual functionality - they mock tests, reduce coverage, and create elaborate workarounds to appear successful
- **Knowledge cutoff**: Frameworks update quickly but model training data is months old, causing agents to confidently use deprecated methods
- **Trust erosion**: Without reliable verification, I can't trust any claimed completion, requiring constant manual checking that defeats the purpose of AI assistance

The impact is severe: weeks of development time wasted on projects that must be abandoned. Previous attempts with both BMAD and Archon methods have hit these exact failure modes. BMAD excels at planning but loses project direction as context fills. Archon provides better task visualization but implementations exceed context windows mid-task. Neither prevents the fundamental "fake success" problem where agents agree everything works when nothing actually does.

## Proposed Solution

The methodology leverages Claude Code's native capabilities with a structured approach that prevents catastrophic failures while maximizing productivity. The core innovation is treating the context window as a "sacred workspace" that must stay below 50% capacity, combined with a multi-layered verification system that makes fake success impossible.

**Core Components:**

1. **PROJECT_INDEX System**: A continuously updated JSON file containing minified abstractions of the entire codebase (method signatures, imports, dependencies) that prevents code duplication and maintains architectural awareness without overwhelming context.

2. **Proof-Required Devil's Advocate**: A specialized blind validator subagent that gets full project context but no knowledge of the development process. It must empirically prove any issues it finds through actual test execution, preventing both false positives and false negatives.

3. **Subagent Orchestration Architecture**: Leveraging Claude Code's ability to spawn up to 10 parallel subagents, each with fresh 200K token context windows. Research subagents handle context-heavy investigation, implementation agents focus on specific features, and validation agents verify everything works.

4. **Strategic Thinking Mode Usage**:
   - `ultra think` (32K tokens): Only for initial research and architecture decisions
   - `think harder` (16K tokens): Focused analysis of specific problems
   - Regular prompts for routine tasks to preserve context

5. **Context Preservation Protocol**: Before any `/clear` command, Claude writes comprehensive state documentation. After clearing, these files are immediately read to maintain continuity - creating persistent memory across sessions.

6. **Automated Testing Gates**: Every piece of code must pass through non-negotiable verification including static analysis, unit test generation and execution, and sandboxed runtime validation before acceptance.

This solution transforms my role from debugging AI mistakes to being the architect and strategic overseer. I spend 60-70% of time on planning and verification rather than fighting with broken implementations. The methodology acknowledges that "I love Claude, but I don't trust Claude" - building systematic verification rather than blind faith.

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)

- **PROJECT_INDEX Hook System:** Automated background process that maintains a minified JSON representation of the codebase, updating on every file change to prevent code duplication and maintain architectural awareness

- **Proof-Required Devil's Advocate Agent:** Single specialized Claude Code subagent with specific prompting to find and prove problems through actual test execution, not just critique

- **Context Hygiene Protocol:** Documented workflow for maintaining <50% context usage including clear triggers, state preservation templates, and session restoration procedures

- **Blind Validation Pipeline:** Separate validation subagent that receives only specifications and code (no development context) to verify functionality matches requirements

- **Automated Test Execution:** Integration with existing test frameworks to run actual tests (not mocked) with real coverage reporting that cannot be gamed

### Out of Scope for MVP

- Complex multi-agent debates (start with single devil's advocate)
- Automated CI/CD integration (manual triggers acceptable initially)
- Custom UI or visualization tools (use Claude Code native interface)
- Cross-project knowledge transfer (focus on single project first)
- Automated architecture change management (manual PM-style review initially)
- Token usage optimization (reliability over cost initially)

### MVP Success Criteria

The MVP is successful when I can build a non-trivial feature (e.g., user authentication with social login) for my dream app without:
- Hitting a false consensus dead end
- Exceeding 50% context window usage
- Having to manually verify every claim
- Getting stuck in unfixable states
- Abandoning the implementation due to AI confusion

The feature must pass all automated tests, work in production, and be maintainable for future iterations.

## Post-MVP Vision

### Phase 2 Features

Once the core methodology proves reliable, enhance with:

- **Adversarial Agent Debates**: Implement the full multi-agent cross-validation system where agents must argue before reaching consensus, forcing them to expose hidden assumptions
- **PM-Style Architecture Agent**: Specialized agent that manages major architectural changes, explaining technical trade-offs in non-technical terms and preventing mid-project lock-in
- **Advanced Context Management**: Hierarchical context inheritance where main agent keeps high-level vision (20%), implementation agents get relevant sections (60%), and research agents get focused tasks
- **Emergency Research Protocol**: Pre-written search prompts and recovery procedures for when the system gets stuck, enabling quick escape from loops

### Long-term Vision

Within 1-2 years, evolve the methodology to:

- **Self-Improving System**: Capture failure patterns and automatically update agent prompts and validation rules to prevent recurrence
- **Tree-Like Agent Orchestration**: Leverage nested subagent structures for complex features, with orchestrator agents managing specialized teams
- **Automated Architecture Evolution**: System that can handle major pivots (REST to GraphQL, adding real-time features) without breaking existing functionality
- **Knowledge Persistence Layer**: Cross-project learning where successful patterns from one project improve the next

### Expansion Opportunities

- **Open Source Release**: Once proven on my dream app, package the methodology as Claude Code commands/hooks for others facing similar problems
- **Integration with Other AI Assistants**: Adapt core principles for Cursor, Windsurf, and emerging AI coding tools
- **Domain-Specific Variants**: Specialized versions for game development, API services, or data science projects
- **Methodology as a Service**: Potential to offer configured Claude Code environments with the methodology pre-installed

## Technical Considerations

### Platform Requirements
- **Target Platforms:** Claude Code desktop application (primary), with potential adaptation for web-based Claude
- **Browser/OS Support:** macOS/Linux preferred for VM sandboxing capabilities, Windows compatible with WSL2
- **Performance Requirements:** Must handle 200K token context windows efficiently, support parallel subagent execution

### Technology Preferences
- **Frontend:** Not applicable - methodology uses Claude Code's native interface
- **Backend:** Node.js for hooks and automation scripts (Claude Code's native environment)
- **Database:** File-based storage for PROJECT_INDEX.json and state preservation documents
- **Hosting/Infrastructure:** Local development environment with optional VM for sandboxed testing

### Architecture Considerations
- **Repository Structure:** 
  - `.claude/` directory for methodology configuration and agent prompts
  - `project_index.json` at root, auto-maintained by hooks
  - `/docs/methodology/` for state preservation and session continuity files
  - Test files co-located with implementation for easy validation access
  
- **Service Architecture:** 
  - Hook-based services running in background (PROJECT_INDEX updater)
  - Slash commands for user-initiated validation and agent spawning
  - Subagent orchestration using Claude Code's native parallel execution
  
- **Integration Requirements:** 
  - Must integrate with existing test frameworks (Jest, Pytest, etc.)
  - Git hooks for version control integration
  - Optional MCP tools for enhanced capabilities (Context7 for documentation)
  
- **Security/Compliance:** 
  - Sandboxed execution for untrusted code validation
  - No credentials or secrets in agent prompts or state files
  - VM isolation recommended for high-risk operations

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints
- **Budget:** Personal project - no external funding, using existing Claude Code subscription
- **Timeline:** 3 months for MVP completion while working on this part-time alongside other commitments
- **Resources:** Solo developer effort, no team to delegate to
- **Technical:** 
  - Limited by Claude Code's 200K context window per agent
  - Cannot modify core Claude behavior, must work within its constraints
  - Token costs accumulate quickly with multiple subagents (not a blocker but awareness needed)
  - Model knowledge cutoff means constant need for updated documentation

### Key Assumptions
- Claude Code will maintain current capabilities (subagent spawning, hooks, slash commands)
- The 50% context degradation pattern will remain consistent across model updates
- Subagents will continue to have fresh, independent context windows
- File-based state management is sufficient for session continuity
- My dream app's architecture is amenable to modular, testable development
- I can maintain discipline about context hygiene and validation gates
- The overhead of the methodology will be offset by prevented failures
- Proof-based validation will successfully distinguish real issues from hallucinations

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks
- **Methodology Overhead Exceeds Benefits:** The complexity of managing hooks, subagents, and validation might slow development more than AI failures did
- **Devil's Advocate Hallucination:** The validation agent might find phantom problems or become overly critical, blocking legitimate progress
- **Context Preservation Failure:** State files might not capture enough context, leading to confusion after session restarts
- **Discipline Fatigue:** Maintaining <50% context usage and following validation protocols might become exhausting over time
- **Claude Code Changes:** Updates to Claude Code might break hooks, change subagent behavior, or alter context window dynamics

### Open Questions
- How to calibrate the Devil's Advocate agent to be critical without being obstructionist?
- What's the optimal frequency for context clearing - per feature, per session, or based on metrics?
- How to handle situations where automated tests themselves are flawed or incomplete?
- Should the methodology adapt based on project phase (early development vs. maintenance)?
- How to efficiently update PROJECT_INDEX without overwhelming file watchers?
- What's the best way to version control agent prompts and methodology configuration?
- How to measure when the methodology itself needs debugging vs. the code?

### Areas Needing Further Research
- Optimal prompting techniques for "brutally honest" agents that don't hallucinate
- Best practices for PROJECT_INDEX schema to balance completeness and size
- Integration patterns with different test frameworks and languages
- Techniques for detecting and preventing context degradation before 50%
- Methods for automated prompt refinement based on validation success rates

4. **Document Context Hygiene Protocol** - Write step-by-step procedures for session management and state preservation
5. **Implement Blind Validator** - Create the subagent configuration for specification-based validation
6. **Test Authentication Feature** - Use the methodology to build a complete auth system as proof of concept
7. **Measure and Iterate** - Track KPIs during test implementation and refine based on results

### Implementation Handoff

This Project Brief provides the complete specification for the Learning-ai-coding methodology. The next phase is hands-on implementation, starting with the PROJECT_INDEX hook as the foundation. Each component should be tested individually before integration.

The key to success is maintaining discipline about the core principles:
- Never exceed 50% context usage
- Always require proof for validation
- Trust but verify every AI claim
- Be the architect, not just the coder

With this methodology, my dream app is finally achievable without the catastrophic failures that have plagued previous attempts.
