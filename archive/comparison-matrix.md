## 2. Initial Setup and Configuration

| Feature | Mastery Prompt | Official Docs | Alignment | Risk Level | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|---------------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| **Command Alias** | `alias c='claude --dangerously-skip-permissions'` | Permission-based architecture by design | üö® | **HIGH** | **Replace**: Use `/permissions` configuration |
| **Local Docs** | "Install claude-code-docs locally" | Built-in documentation access | üîÑ | Low | **Enhance**: Both approaches valid |
| **Keyboard Shortcuts** | `'u' ‚Üí 'ultra think'` | No official shortcuts | üîÑ | Medium | **Caution**: Risk of accidental expensive operations |
| **Project Index System** | Custom minified codebase indexing | Glob/Grep tools for codebase navigation | üîÑ | Medium | **Evaluate**: May be unnecessary complexity |

### Security Analysis: YOLO Mode
**Critical Finding:** The `--dangerously-skip-permissions` recommendation directly contradicts Claude Code's core security design.

**Official Security Model:**
- "Permission-based architecture" 
- "Explicit approval" for sensitive operations
- "Users control whether to approve actions once or allow them automatically"

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Enterprise Risk:** Unsuitable for team environments
- **Personal Risk:** Bypasses safety mechanisms
- **Official Alternative:** Use `/permissions` to configure specific allowlists
